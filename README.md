Automatic Length Inference Scoring System

Developed for Drone-Assisted Seated Chair Bocce, the world's hottest new sport.
Take an aerial picture of each round of the game, upload them to ALISS, and sit
back as she locates the balls, calculates their distances from the jack, and
tallies the final score.

NOTE: ALISS is great for long-term tracking of scores and statistics, but the
Inference bit of her name means she is no susbstitute for a good Senior Head
Chief Regional Supervising Referee. Final rulings are up to the SHCRSR.
